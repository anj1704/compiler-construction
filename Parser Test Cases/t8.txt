%Test Case 3: Syntactically correct testcase
%Following program computes the average marks obtained by students in three subjects

%Following function reads marks of a student in all subjects and returns as a record variable
% Note that the variable b7 is not used anywhere but it is the syntactic requirement to have 
% atleast one input parameter
% Notice here that  your compiler recognizes the type definition of marks even before it is 
% declared. This will be handled at the semantic analyzer phase.


%The following program computes the average of marks of total d5cb34567  students
_main 
	type int : b5;
	b5 <--- 1;
    return;
end
